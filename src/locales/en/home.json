In many cases, tokenomics is the right mechanism for members to connect their wallets,propose,review,and vote on treasury or protocol decisions. Based on the bonding curve there is no need of cost, even initial liquidity, to launch a token by your own."

        "text": "A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that defines the relationship between the supply and price of a token. It is a decentralized way to buy and sell Projects without the need for an exchange. Bonding curves are often used in DeFi projects to allow users to buy and sell Projects directly from the project's treasury."

        "title": "What does a bonding curve bring to a Web3 project and its community?",
        "text": "Bonding curves are a decentralized and transparent way to distribute Projects. They allow anyone to buy Projects directly from the project's treasury, rather than through a centralized exchange. This helps to ensure that Projects are distributed more efficiently and fairly, as whales with large holdings cannot control the price. <br/><br/> Bonding curves also provide a way for investors to buy Projects at a fixed price. This protects them from volatility in the market and encourages them to buy Projects early. This can help to build a strong community around the project and increase its chances of success."
